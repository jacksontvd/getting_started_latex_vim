# Guide to getting started with LaTeX and Vim:

I wrote this document to archive the process of setting up my workflow for taking notes
and writing papers in case I needed to reference it for some reason in the future. 
I figured there's no reason not to share it, in case someone might find it useful.
This is by no means exhaustive, and is meant as a jumping-off-point. The actual
documentation of the various software/packages should be the reader's next stop.
